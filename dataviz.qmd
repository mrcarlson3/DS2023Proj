## Visuals

```{python}
#line graph of player load per minute 
monthly_avg = df.groupby(['Month', 'Position'], as_index=False).agg({ #This creates a new dataframe which groups data by month and position and takes the average of each
    'Player Load Per Minute': 'mean',
    'Explosive Efforts': 'mean',
    'Total IMA': 'mean'
})

fig_load = px.line( #Makes a line graph with 3 lines showing average Player Load Per Minute over time by Position
    monthly_avg, #Uses the data from the monthly_avg dataframe
    x='Month', 
    y='Player Load Per Minute', 
    color='Position', #Colors each line by position
    markers=True, #Adds a marker at each data point
    title='Monthly Average: Player Load Per Minute by Position' #Adds title
)

fig_load.update_layout(  #Adds labels and makes the graph interactive
    xaxis_title='Month', 
    yaxis_title='Avg Player Load Per Minute',
    hovermode='x unified',
     xaxis=dict(
        range=['2023-09-01', '2024-03-30']  # Set desired zoom window
    )
)

fig_load.show() #Shows plot

fig_load.write_image('player_load_per_minute.png') #Saves plot as PNG file
```

The graph above illustrates how player load per minute has fluctuated throughout the past two seasons, emphasizing the importance of adjusting training and recovery plans throughout the year.

```{python}
fig_effort = px.line( #Makes a line graph with 3 lines showing average Explosive Efforts over time by Position
    monthly_avg, #Uses the new monthly_avg dataset
    x='Month',
    y='Explosive Efforts',
    color='Position', #Each line is a different color which correlates with position
    markers=True, #Adds markers at each data point
    title='Monthly Average: Explosive Efforts by Position' #Adds title
)

fig_effort.update_layout(  #Adds labels and makes the graph interactive
    xaxis_title='Month', 
    yaxis_title='Avg Explosive Efforts',
    hovermode='x unified',
     xaxis=dict(
        range=['2023-10-01', '2024-03-30']  # Set desired zoom window
    )
)

fig_effort.show() #Displays plot

fig_effort.write_image('effort.png') #Saves plot as PNG file

```

The graph above illustrates how Explosive Efforts by position decreased initially, then increased significantly for each position for the majority of the rest of the season.
```{python}

fig_ima = px.line( #Makes a line graph with 3 lines showing average Total IMA over time by Position
    monthly_avg, #Uses the dataframe monthly_avg
    x='Month',
    y='Total IMA',
    color='Position', #Colors each line by position
    markers=True, #Adds markers to each data point
    title='Monthly Average: Total IMA by Position' #Adds graph title
)

fig_ima.update_layout( #Adds labels and makes the graph interactive
    xaxis_title='Month',
    yaxis_title='Avg Total IMA',
    hovermode='x unified',
     xaxis=dict(
        range=['2023-10-01', '2024-03-30']  # Set desired zoom window
    )
)

fig_ima.show() #Displays plot

fig_ima.write_image('ima.png') #Saves plot as PNG file
```

As seen in the graph above, Total IMA has decreased for the majority of the past two seasons, with little variability between positions.
