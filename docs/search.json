    "text": "3.1.1 Important Variables within this Dataset\n\nTotal Player Load: Total physical effort during a session. This is important for our analysis to see how much work the athlete is doing overall. Player Load Per Minute: Effort per minute (intensity). This is important for our analysis to see the intensity/effort players are putting in. Higher pl per minute means they are most likely sprinting/exerting lots of energy which may take longer recovery. Explosive Efforts: Number of high-intensity movements. This is important because high intensity movements can cause strain on muscles leading to potential injuries. Session Total Jump: Total jumps in a session. This is important because positions that jump a lot may need more recovery due to the strain this puts on tendons. Especially since jumps are very frequent in basketball. Session Jumps Per Minute: Jumps per minute (jump intensity). This can identify positions that may be at risk for knee injury if they have a very high rate of jumps per minutes. Total IMA: Total number of movements (all intensities). This is important to analyze all movement and not just high intensity movement. IMA/Min: Number of movements per minute. This is important to track endurance by position. Position: This is important for our analysis to compare all of our variables against position.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Cleaning the data\n\n# import libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as

The largest difference by position is Player Load per Minute. As seen in the side-by-side histograms, centers have significantly lower player load per minute than forwards and guards. This is crucial information we will utilize to illustrate to strength and conditioning coaches that there may be more productive ways to train and recover depending on the position.",
